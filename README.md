# Hangman
This Hangman game selects a random word from a predefined list and allows the player to guess letters to reveal the word. 
Players have 13 attempts to guess the word correctly. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of attempts remaining. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. The script provides feedback on each guess and a final message indicating whether the player has won or lost.
